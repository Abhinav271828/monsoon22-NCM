# Decision-Making
The abstract model of decision-making consists of three main stages – gathering sensory evidence, accumulating it, and categorising it.

Population models mathematically implement this, but are extremely complicated and may use thousands of equations. We use techniques like mean-field reduction to convert these to 2D systems, amenable to analysis.  
In such systems, saddle points represent temporary equilibrium points between the basins of attraction of the attractors representing each choice. At high coherences (of evidence), the trajectory always goes to the favoured attractor, and eventually the unfavoured attractor disappears.

Decision making by the brain gives rise to questions of intention and free will. Experiments have been done to indicate that the brain generates the intention to perform an action before the person becomes aware of it.

Haggard described a *naturalised model of human volition*, in which there are various stages:

* the early "whether": motivations and reasons
* the "what": task and action selection
* the late "whether": final predictive check
* action execution
* the "when": external environmental stimuli
